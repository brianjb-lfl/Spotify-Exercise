### Spotify Recommends - Exercise

* Follow the instructions at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/MrSkinny/de578cbd2cc6335a8b6a095ed3762738)
* Run the server using `http-server` -- the authentication process expects the server to be running at the default `http://localhost:8080`
* Once you've setup with Spotify, make sure to add your `CLIENT_ID` to `spotify.js` and set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/auth.html`
